# What is this?

This was a "fun" project I have made in 2016, the program is basically a machine that can apply several commands that are given to it. Typing "help" the commands that are possible are randomly shown in the right above corner. 

# List of commands

* "info" (or "help") : Shows available commands randomly at the right above corner.
* "hi" (or "hello","hey"), "greetings" : The machine responds with one of the words "hi","hello","hey", "greetings".
* "clean" (or "cls", "clear") : The machine cleans the window.
* "frame" (or "border","art") : Draws the borders of the screen.
* ""stop" (or "wait", "pause") : Pauses the program.
* "score" (or "highscore") : Shows a score at the left above corner.
* "transparent" (or "rgba","alpha") : Makes the screen transparent.
* "circle" (or "ball","arc") : Creates a ball.
* "circles" (or "balls") : Creates more balls.


* "background" : Randomly changes the background collor.
* "red" (or "blue","black","orange","cyan","green","yellow"): Changes the background to entered color.
